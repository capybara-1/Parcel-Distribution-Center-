# Parcel-Distribution-Center-
This is a simulation of a Parcel Distribution Center in a airport from the birds-eye view
Generates 20 Parcels of a random colour (between Blue, Yellow, and Green) and a size (between 20 - 100px).

The Colours stand for BLUE - International, GREEN - Domestic, YELLOW - Unknown 

All the parcels are displayed on a conveyor belt. When the parcel enters the center scanner it is divied to 3 other conveyor belts. If it's BLUE then it goes on the conveyor belt that is heading up. If it's GREEN then it goes on the conveyor belt going straight ahead. If it's YELLOW then it goes on the conveyor belt that's heading down. 

Based on these directions it displays a image on the bottom right corner. International (blue) is a plane, Domestic (green) is a truck, and Unknown (yellow) is a question mark.

The Conveyor belt stops and starts with a press of the space bar.
